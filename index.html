                                    By legislation, LabDax is required to respond to any personal data requests within 30 days, except the kind of request demands more time for proper investigation and assessment. The rights available to you regarding the personal information LabDax holds about you are outlined below:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Right to access your data. This allows you to receive a copy of the personal data LabDax holds about you.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Right to request correction of the personal data LabDax holds about you. This allows you to correct any incomplete or inaccurate data LabDax holds about you. LabDax may request extra information and documentation to validate the need for such a request.
                                </p>

                                    Right to request for the deletion of your personal information on our platform. You can ask LabDax to erase your data, applying your right “to be forgotten”, where there is no good reason for LabDax to continue processing it. This request to delete your data will lead to the closure of your account and termination of our relationship with you.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Right to request to ‘block’ or suppress the processing of your data in certain circumstances, such as if you contest the accuracy of such personal information or object to us processing your information. It will not stop LabDax from storing your personal information. 
                                    LabDax will inform you before LabDax decides not to agree with any requested restriction. If LabDax has disclosed your personal information to others, LabDax will inform about the restriction if possible. If you ask LabDax, if possible and lawful to do so, LabDax will also tell you with whom LabDax has shared your personal information so that you can contact them directly also.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Right to object to the processing of your data for any direct marketing. This also includes profiling in as much as it is related to direct marketing. If you object to processing for direct marketing purposes, then LabDax shall stop the processing of your data for such purposes.
                                </p>

                                    Right to object, at any time, to any decisions that LabDax may take that are purely based on automated processing (including profiling). Profiling involves using technology that helps us make decisions automatically, based on your data that LabDax collects from you or third parties.
